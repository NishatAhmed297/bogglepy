Solving the boggle game using Python with straightforward recursion (no Tries or anything fancy). 
This code started its life as part of the 1 December 2011 London Python Dojo (Team 1)

For fun a sequential and parallel version (using multiprocessing) of the solutoin routine can be run.

Its not particularly optimized for speed but should do the job.
